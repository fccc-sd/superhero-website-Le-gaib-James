                    Earth becomes a wasteland due to relentless environmental neglect and reckless consumption by humanity. 
                    This devastation leads to the extinction of plant and animal life, forcing the remnants of humanity to abandon the planet.
                    <p>This part will also describe 1 of his enemies and allies perks and flaws</p>

                     <p>Before you go I just wanted to say thank you for visiting my website I truly hope you have an amazing day and you're an amazing person.</p>
                      My favorite character is Wall-e because I relate to him in many ways.
        One of the main reasons I relate to him is, he doesn't "talk" much like me I know he's a robot but you know what I mean.
        I also relate to him in the sense of being alone a lot. It's easy to be forgotten in society now-a-days which happened to him. 
        Another way I relate to him is he has fun picking random stuff up and collecting it I like collecting a lot of different things 
        no matter what it is. Finally the last way I relate to him is he's skeptical about new people I've learned in life to not trust everything
        someone says especially new people. Wall-E's origin story starts on earth in 2805 A.D where the humans that lived on it destroyed it and left it full of trash
        so he's one of the last trash robots that still functions. But then one day EVE a robot sent down by Axiom (the ship all the humans are on)
        and her mission is to find plant life on earth. When Wall-E hands her a plant he's been protecting she stores it inside of her 
        then a homing beacon goes over her trying to take her back to the ship but then she defects from her mission and then runs away with Wall-E.
        Construction: Hydraulic shovels for arms with articulated fingers mounted on his tracks to his sides. Energy Regeneration: He has a solar-powered regeneration as his energy source. Super-high-efficiency solar panels unfold from the top of his chest and recharge the batteries to his control system. Control System: WALL-E's eyes are camera lenses, indicating that visual recognition is his primary means of navigation. They can magnify and resolve images at a distance, even independently. In addition to visual, he appears to have audio and some rudimentary tactile sense, given that he can detect things that his hands or treads touch. He also contains an alert system, warning him when dust storms are approaching on Earth's surface. Trash Disposal:Two powerful hydraulic presses on his back operate his compactor function, 
        compressing trash in his body cavity into neat cubes that can be easily stacked and carted away
